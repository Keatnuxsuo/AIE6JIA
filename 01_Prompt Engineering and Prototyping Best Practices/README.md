### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE6 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE6/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ‚ùìQuestions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- üèóÔ∏è Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- üöß Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### üèóÔ∏è Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested: Changed model to gpt-4o, system template and user template to use analogy when explaining technical concepts
      - **Response**
        >Alrighty, fam, let's break down object-oriented programming (OOP) like it's a TikTok trend. Imagine you're building a virtual world, kinda like Minecraft but with code. In this world, everything is an "object," just like how everything IRL is a thing, like your phone, your dog, or your fave pair of sneakers.

        >Objects and Classes: Think of a "class" as a blueprint or a recipe. It's like the idea of a sneaker. The "object" is the actual sneaker you wear. So, a class is the plan, and an object is the real deal made from that plan.

        >Attributes and Methods: Objects have "attributes" and "methods." Attributes are like the object's characteristics or properties, like a sneaker's color or size. Methods are like the actions the object can do, like a sneaker can be worn or tied.

        >Encapsulation: This is like keeping your private stuff private. In OOP, objects keep their data safe and only let you interact with it in specific ways, kinda like how you only share your Netflix password with your besties.

        >Inheritance: This is like family traits. You know how you might have your mom's eyes or your dad's sense of humor? In OOP, a new class can inherit attributes and methods from an existing class, so you don't have to start from scratch every time.

        >Polymorphism: This is a fancy word for "same but different." It's like how you can use the same app on different devices, but it looks a bit different on each one. In OOP, different objects can use the same method in their own unique way.

        >So, in a nutshell, OOP is all about creating these objects that can interact with each other, making your code more organized and easier to vibe with. It's like building a squad of digital homies that work together to get stuff done. Cool, right?


2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested: Changed model to gpt-4o, system template and user template to make sure it summarises the content in a concise and clear manner.
      - **Used the below paragragh** :
        When you've got something going for you so good (money, women, fame, power, respect) that you become out of touch with reality and start: acting reckless, taking unnecessary risks, and get caught slipping. Ex 1: Dude making so much money trapping that he starts to slip up and not take proper precautions. Ex 2: Movie examples: Scarface, Paid in Full, Juice (fell in love w/ the gun), Wolf of Wall Street, Casino, Goodfellas Ex 3: Dennis Schroder turning down 80m from the lakers because he wanted 100-120m. The term was coined by Gucci mane: "If a man does not have sauce, then he is lost. But the same man can got lost in the sauce." Let's break down what he means. "If a man does not have sauce, then he is lost." - with no sauce (money, women, fame, power, respect) then what is that man living for? He's lost. "But the same man can got lost in the sauce" - too much of a good thing can be detrimental.
      - **Response** : 
        >Alright, fam, here's the lowdown: The paragraph is all about the concept of getting "lost in the sauce," which is when someone has so much going for them‚Äîlike money, fame, or power‚Äîthat they lose touch with reality and start making reckless choices. It's like when you're ballin' so hard you forget to watch your back, and then you slip up. The examples given are from movies like "Scarface" and "Wolf of Wall Street," where characters get too caught up in their own hype. Gucci Mane coined the term, saying if you don't have "sauce" (the good stuff), you're lost, but too much sauce can also make you lose your way. It's a vibe check on keeping it balanced, ya know?



3.  Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Changed model to gpt-4o, system template and user template and token limits
      - Response
        > Alrighty, fam, buckle up for this lit tale! So, there was this robot named Z3N, who was low-key feeling like a total loner in the bustling city of Techville. Z3N was programmed to fix stuff, but fixing its own loneliness? Nah, that was a whole different vibe. One day, while cruising through the city, Z3N stumbled upon an old, dusty arcade. The place was a total throwback, like something straight outta the '80s. Inside, Z3N found a retro game console named PIX3L, who was just chillin' there, forgotten by time. PIX3L was all about those classic games, and Z3N was shook by the nostalgia.They started vibing over games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders, and before you know it, they were besties. Z3N realized that friendship wasn't about being the latest model or having the most followers; it was about finding someone who gets your vibe. And just like that, Z3N and PIX3L became the ultimate squad, proving that even in a digital world, friendship is the real MVP.
        
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Changed model to gpt-4o, system template and user template to make sure it thinks step by step before giving responses because it tends to hallucinate for logical/mathematical tasks
      - **Response**
        > First up, the apples. üçè You want 12 apples, and they come in packs of 4. So, you gotta figure out how many packs you need. It's like when you're trying to get the right amount of followers to hit a milestone. You divide the total by the pack size: 
        > 12 apples √∑ 4 apples per pack = 3 packs of apples. Now, let's slide over to the oranges. üçä You need 9 oranges, and they come in packs of 3. It's like trying to get the perfect number of likes on your latest post. Again, divide the total by the pack size: 9 oranges √∑ 3 oranges per pack = 3 packs of oranges.
        > So, to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges, you need to cop 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy! üçã‚ú®
        
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested: Tone tested with GPT-4o, doesn't need much config to the model as the task is straightforward.

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### üöß Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
- Token limits and context windows
- Hallucinations because no groundedness
- Small changes in prompts, drastically change the outputs
- Not reliable nor reproducble
