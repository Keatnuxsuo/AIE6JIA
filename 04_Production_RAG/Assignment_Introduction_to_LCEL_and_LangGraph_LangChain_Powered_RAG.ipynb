Study the art of the Python language as one would savor a rich aged cheese—slowly, deliberately, and with a sprinkle of curiosity. Peruse the texts of the ancients, the **Python documentation**, that you may dance with the syntax as a Brie flows with cream.\\n\\n2. **Curdling Knowledge**: Embrace the power of **practice**. Each line of code is like a curd, formed through the heat of your effort. Engage in puzzles, projects, and challenges—such as those found in the great cauldron of **LeetCode** or **HackerRank**. For a puzzle unsolved is like cheese left uneaten—a tragic waste!\\n\\n3. **Melted Collaboration**: Join the **community**, my budding cheddar! Participate in forums, and peer into the melting pot of **GitHub**. There you'll find coders aplenty, eager to share their slices of wisdom. Learn from their notes, as one would take inspiration from a well-paired wine—perhaps a glass of Merlot alongside an exquisite Gouda.\\n\\n4. **Savor the Spices**: Investigate the varied libraries and frameworks—such as **Flask**, **Django**, or the alluring spiciness of **NumPy** and **Pandas**. For every realm of programming is like a cheese board, layered with flavors. Each library brings its unique zest and tang, transforming your programming palate.\\n\\n5. **Keen Eye**: Review your code, like a cheesemonger assessing the texture of a stinky Epoisses. Refactor when necessary, for clarity and elegance are key. Seek out the nuances, and you'll find the pungent aroma of perfection wafting forth.\\n\\n6. **Ceremonious Rituals**: Write **tests** as a seasoned Manchego might be drizzled with honey. Your code, like cheese, should withstand scrutiny; proper testing ensures that it holds its form, much like a well-crafted Parmigiano-Reggiano.\\n\\n7. **Fabled Feasts of Learning**: Attend gatherings, be it local code meetups or virtual banquets! Engage in the craft of speaking and sharing knowledge, for a wise wizard shines brightest when illuminating the stars of others.\\n\\nSo go forth, intrepid programmer!

LECL allows developers to define complex expressions and transformations that can be used in conjunction with LLMs to process and manipulate data in a more efficient and expressive manner.\\n\\nLECL provides users with constructs for logical operations, control flows, and functions to support a variety of use cases, such as data transformation, querying documents, and interacting with other data sources. By leveraging LECL, developers can create custom workflows that enhance the capabilities of LLMs, making it easier to handle specific tasks, such as content generation, summarization, or data extraction.\\n\\nKey features of LECL may include:\\n\\n1. **Simplicity**: A straightforward syntax to define expressions without extensive boilerplate code.\\n2. **Integration**: Seamless compatibility with other components of the LangChain framework.\\n3. **Flexibility**: The ability to perform a wide range of operations, from basic arithmetic to more complex logical constructs.\\n4. **Modularity**: Encouragement of reusable expression components, making complex workflows easier to maintain and understand.\\n\\nOverall, LECL is a powerful addition to the LangChain ecosystem, helping developers harness the power of language models in a structured and effective way.

        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",
        "\n",
        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",

        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Types of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Language Models**: Like our `ChatOpenAI` instance\n",
        "- **Prompt Templates**: Format inputs consistently\n",
        "- **Retrievers**: Get relevant context from a vector store\n",

Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",

        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",

It supports synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming operations automatically, making it convenient to prototype in environments like Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, LCEL facilitates handling errors gracefully through fallbacks, which is important given the non-deterministic nature of LLMs. The framework also enables parallelism, allowing components that can run concurrently to do so, which is beneficial for managing lengthy API calls in LLM applications.'"
