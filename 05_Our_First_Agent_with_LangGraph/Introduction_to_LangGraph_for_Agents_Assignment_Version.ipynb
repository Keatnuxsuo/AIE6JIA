        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

It is an approach in natural language processing (NLP) that combines two main components:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: The system first retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large database or knowledge base, based on the user's query.\\n2. **Generation**: Then, a language model (like GPT) uses the retrieved information to generate a more accurate, informed, and contextually relevant response.\\n\\n### How RAG Works\\n\\n- When a user asks a question, the system searches (retrieves) for relevant documents or passages.\\n- These retrieved texts are then provided as additional context to a generative language model.\\n- The language model uses both the user’s question and the retrieved information to generate a final answer.\\n\\n### Why Use RAG?\\n\\n- **Improved Accuracy**: By grounding responses in real, up-to-date information, RAG models can provide more factual and reliable answers.\\n- **Scalability**: RAG can access vast external knowledge bases, making it more scalable than models relying solely on their internal training data.\\n- **Reduced Hallucination**: It helps reduce the risk of the model making up information (“hallucination”), as it can cite or use real sources.\\n\\n### Example Use Cases\\n\\n- **Question Answering**: Providing answers to questions using up-to-date documents.\\n- **Enterprise Search**: Helping employees find information in company documents.\\n- **Customer Support**: Answering customer queries using a knowledge base.\\n\\n### Popular Implementations\\n\\n- **Facebook AI’s RAG model**: One of the first and most well-known implementations.\\n- **OpenAI’s GPT with retrieval plugins**: Similar concept, used in some advanced applications.\\n\\n**In summary:**  \\nRAG is a method that augments generative AI models with real-time retrieval of external information, leading to more accurate and context-aware responses.\""

It is a technique used to adapt large machine learning models (such as large language models) to new tasks or contexts without retraining the entire model. Instead of updating all the parameters, LoRA adds small, trainable low-rank matrices to the frozen (unchanged) original model. During fine-tuning, only these new matrices are updated, which makes the process much more efficient in terms of computation and memory. This allows for quick adaptation to new tasks with minimal resources.

His work focuses on making large foundation models (like ChatGPT) more accessible by reducing their resource requirements, enabling them to run on consumer hardware. He is known for his research on efficient deep learning, including methods for reducing the memory and computational footprint of large models.

What is Attention in machine learning?\\nThe attention mechanism is a technique in machine learning, especially in natural language processing, that allows models to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data. Instead of treating all input information equally, attention assigns different weights to different parts, enabling the model to prioritize important features. This mechanism is crucial in tasks like machine translation, where the model needs to focus on specific words or phrases in the input sequence. Attention mechanisms are foundational to modern architectures like Transformers, which power large language models.
